            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD candidate at Penn State in the College of Information Sciences and Technology. I study cognitive and computational linguistics, with a focus on methods that can leverage big data while also considering cognitive plausibility. This will probably gain more information as I prepare to apply for full-time positions, but in the meantime, check out these links, which has information about the projects I've worked on and the code that produced them.</p>
